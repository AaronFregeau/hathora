## Motivation

Building a multiplayer game can be extremely challenging. On top of the challenges of building a single player game, you now have to constantly battle the network and latency, find ways to prevent cheating, and figure out how to make a scalable backend architecture.

Hathora's abstractions greatly simplify these aspects so that you can focus on what matters - making your game!
